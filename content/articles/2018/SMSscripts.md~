## **Introduction**
In the previous article, we proposed a method to create alerts on trading view, recieve these alerts by email, tag these alerts with a label and forward these alerts to our mobile phone by MMS. In this article we show a special case of a mobile operator [(Free Mobile France)](www.free.fr) which offers the facility for us to forward email messages to our mobile phone as an sms message. We will make use of the google scripts and the powerful gmail API to access and read our email in real-time and forward the required messages.
